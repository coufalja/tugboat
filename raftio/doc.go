/*
Package raftio contains structs, interfaces and function definitions required
to build custom persistent Raft log storage and transport modules.

Structs, interfaces and functions defined in the raftio package are only
required when building your custom persistent Raft log storage or transport
modules. Skip this package if you plan to use the default built-in LogDB and
transport modules provided by Tugboat.
